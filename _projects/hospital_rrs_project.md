# Hospital Rapid Response System and Method for Emergency Patients Using Biosignal Monitoring

## Overview
This project presents a **patented AI-driven system** (KR20240104996A) that uses **Temporal Variational Autoencoders (TVAE)** to predict clinical deterioration in hospital patients up to 3.1 hours in advance. The system integrates LSTM-based architectures with variational autoencoders to enhance hospital Rapid Response System (RRS) performance.

## Key Innovation
- **Early Detection**: 3.1-hour average lead time for clinical deterioration events
- **Superior Performance**: 6.3% improvement in AUROC and 11.3% improvement in AUPRC over traditional EWS
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous monitoring with sliding window framework
- **Reduced False Alarms**: Enhanced specificity while maintaining high sensitivity

## Performance Results

| Metric | TVAE (Proposed) | DEWS (Baseline) | Improvement |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| AUROC | **0.873 ± 0.018** | 0.821 ± 0.020 | +6.3% |
| AUPRC | **0.781 ± 0.022** | 0.702 ± 0.028 | +11.3% |
| Sensitivity | **0.854** | 0.782 | +9.2% |
| Specificity | 0.894 | 0.861 | +3.8% |
| Lead Time | **3.1 ± 0.7 hours** | 2.0 ± 0.5 hours | +55% |

## Clinical Applications
- **General Ward Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of non-ICU patients
- **ICU Transfer Prediction**: Early identification of patients requiring intensive care
- **Cardiac Arrest Prevention**: Proactive intervention before cardiac events
- **Sepsis Detection**: Early recognition of systemic inflammatory response
- **Respiratory Failure Prediction**: Monitoring for acute respiratory deterioration

## Technical Features
- **Multi-task Learning**: Combines reconstruction and classification objectives
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Variational approach captures uncertainty in predictions
- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM architecture captures long-term dependencies
- **Scalable Framework**: Server-based architecture supports hospital-wide deployment

## Impact
- **Patient Safety**: Proactive intervention reduces in-hospital mortality rates
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Automated monitoring reduces manual assessment burden
- **Resource Optimization**: Better allocation of Rapid Response Team resources
- **Quality Improvement**: Data-driven insights for continuous system enhancement
